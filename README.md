1. **difference between algorithm and model**
   * model is to methematize the actual problem and algorithm is to solve the methematized problem contained in it.
   * however, algorithm and model are important parts of a mochine learning system, an algorithm is a set of well-defined programs or instructions that is run on data to create a machine learning model to perform specific tasks.A machine learning model is an expression of an algorithm that runs on data and represents what has already been learned by the ML algorithm.
2. **learning plane**
   * have a preliminary understanding of bioimformatics.
   * grasp R,linux and try to use these to solve some actual problems.
   * have a deeper understanding of the field of biology.
